iracing-forum-declutterer
=================

Userscript for iRacing forums that hides (read) stickied and (read) locked threads because they aren't maintained and take up much 
of the screen. i.e. "iRacing on Linux" in the general discussion.  Unread stickied and unread locked still show. The staff announcements 
forum remains unfiltered, and "Setups" and "Tuning" stickies are also left alone.

# Installation
This script is [installable from GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/3754-iracing-forum-declutterer).

For those of you that don't use it, I recommend the chrome extension Tampermonkey by Jan Biniok.  It makes it easy to add userscripts and also triggers updating them when they are updated elsewhere  You may use this script with or without it, but I do recommend it.
